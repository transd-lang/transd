# TransD

## What is Transd?

Transd is a programming language, implemented as an ultra-compact C++ embeddable library. Its main purpose is to serve as "front end" language: a tool for processing user input, for writing and reading complex configuration files, for customizing and extending the functionality of your program by the user, for processing and importing external textual data, for scripting, etc. 

## What is Transd's unique offering?

In two C++ source files with no external dependencies you get a multi-platform, fast, full featured powerful programming language with many modern features. These features include classes, data query language, first-class functions, exceptions, etc.

## Who are potential users of Transd?

If you are a C++ developer, chances are Transd can be of use for your program as a compact, multi-platform and multi-purpose tool for extending, configuring and maintaining your program at post-compile time. Basically, you include in your program a full featured language interpreter with which your program can run and use the computation results of any program written on Transd.
