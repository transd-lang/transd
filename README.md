# TRANSD
### Welcome to Transd Programming Language

 Transd (short for Transformation and Analysis of Structured Data) is a statically typed, general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language, which:

 * has extended functionality for data processing, such as a built-in data query language for working with tables and collections of records in a database-like fashion;
 * has a very compact implementation (two C++ files with less than 25 KLOCS);
 * uses an innovative execution model - virtual compilation - which doesn't include just-in-time compilation and in the same time offers a good performance.

Currently, Transd is in alpha-stage of development with the planned first 
beta-release in the first quarter of 2022. The syntax of the language is established. The functionality is ready on  85-90%. (There are many examples of [short programs](https://transd.org/doc/rosexamp.html).)

## Code snippets

### Iterating a vector

```
(with v [1,2,3,4,5,6] 

    (for i in v do (textout i " ")

    (textout "\n")

    (for i in v where (not (mod i 2)) do (textout i " ")
)
// <= 1 2 3 4 5 6
// <= 2 4 6
```

### List comprehension
The 'for' statement is used not only for iterations, but for list comprehensions as well.

```
(with list1 (for i in Range(22) where (not (mod i 3)) project (* i i) )

    (textout list1)
)
// <= [0, 9, 36, 81, 144, 225, 324, 441] 
```

### Classes and lambdas

```
class Speaker : {

    say: Lambda<String String>(),

    @init: (位 f Lambda<String String>() (rebind say f )),

    call: (位 s String() (ret (exec say s)))
}

MainModule: {

     greeter: Lambda<String String>(位 s String() (ret (+ "Hello, " s "!"))),

    _start: (位 

        (with sp Speaker( greeter )

            (textout (call sp "World"))
    )   )
}
// Output: Hello, World!
```
