# Welcome to Transd Programming Language

 Transd is a statically typed, general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language, which:

 * has extended functionality for data processing, such as a built-in data query language for working with tables and collections of records in a database-like fashion;
 * has a very compact implementation (two C++ files with less than 25 KLOCS);
 * uses an innovative execution model - virtual compilation - which doesn't include just-in-time compilation and in the same time offers a good performance.

Currently, Transd is in intensive alpha-stage of development with the planned first 
beta-release in the first quarter of 2022. The syntax of the language is established, though minor tweaks are possible, and the functionality is ready on  80-85%. 
(There many examples of working short programs.)
